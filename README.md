# shitty-VZN-blacklist
a broad and unmanicured blocklist created for sus verizon connections with an IP range of 72.21.80.0-72.21.95.255

I made this beacuse I have noticed some suspect connections to random addresses which are listed under WHOIS as belonging to MCI comm services and Verizon. I do not like talking to strange servers, so this will hopefully cut down on unwanted connections and not break too many things
.
When researched further, the addresses that I was connectiing to had been reported hundreds of times for abuse relating to but not limited to:
phishing spam, SSH brute force attempts, port scans, SYN floods, ping of death, DoS attempts and more.
